**Abstract:**   
The electrical activity of insulin-secreting pancreatic islets of Langerhans
is characterized by bursts of action potentials. Most often this bursting is
periodic, but in some cases it is modulated by an underlying slower rhythm. We
suggest that the modulatory rhythm for this complex bursting pattern is due to
oscillations in glycolysis, while the bursting itself is generated by some
other slow process. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we couple a minimal model
of glycolytic oscillations to a minimal model for activity-dependent bursting
in islets. We show that the combined model can reproduce several complex
bursting patterns from mouse islets published in the literature, and we
illustrate how these complex oscillations are produced through the use of a
fast/slow analysis.
